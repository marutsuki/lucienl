                    Express is my go-to library to spin up a quick API for
                    I/O based operations. I usually find myself pairing Express with other popular NodeJS libraries, such as
                    Passport, Mongoose, and Axios.

                    and monolithic legacy codebases.

                    I have extensive experience working with the many Spring Boot starters and libraries, 
                    including Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, Spring Security, Spring Kafka.

                    Kafka is one of the most powerful distributed messaging
                    systems out there. I consider myself extremely lucky to acquire
                    professional exposure and knowledge of this large scale tool.
